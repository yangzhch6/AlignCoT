[Question]: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
[Solution]: 
Let's think step by step.
First, we know that there were originally 15 trees in the grove.
Then, the grove workers planted some trees.
After they finished, there were 21 trees in total.
So, to find out how many trees they planted, we subtract the original number of trees from the final number of trees.
That is, 21 - 15 = 6.
So, the grove workers planted 6 trees today.
Answer: 6.

[Question]: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?
[Solution]: 
Let's think step by step.
First, Jason had 20 lollipops. Then he gave some to Denny and now he has 12 lollipops.

So, 20 - 12 = 8. 
Therefore, Jason gave 8 lollipops to Denny.

[Solution]: 
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how much Olivia spent on bagels. She bought 5 bagels for $3 each, so she spent 5 * $3 = $15.
