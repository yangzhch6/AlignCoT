[Question]: Adam bought 9.0 packages of cat food and 7.0 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 10.0 cans, and each package of dog food contained 5.0 cans. How many more cans of cat food than dog food did Adam buy?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how many cans of cat food Adam bought. 
He bought 9.0 packages of cat food, and each package contained 10.0 cans. 
So, he bought 9.0 * 10.0 = 90.0 cans of cat food.
Next, let's calculate how many cans of dog food Adam bought. 
He bought 7.0 packages of dog food, and each package contained 5.0 cans. 
So, he bought 7.0 * 5.0 = 35.0 cans of dog food.
Finally, let's calculate how many more cans of cat food than dog food Adam bought. 
He bought 90.0 cans of cat food and 35.0 cans of dog food. 
So, he bought 90.0 - 35.0 = 55.0 more cans of cat food than dog food.
Answer: 55.0


[Question]: In a bag there are 13.0 red marbles, 5.0 blue marbles, and 7.0 green marbles. What percent of the marbles are green?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate the total number of marbles in the bag. 
The total number of marbles is 13.0 red marbles + 5.0 blue marbles + 7.0 green marbles = 25.0 marbles.
Next, let's calculate the percentage of the marbles that are green. 
The percentage is the number of green marbles divided by the total number of marbles, multiplied by 100. 
So, the percentage of green marbles is (7.0 green marbles / 25.0 total marbles) * 100 = 28%.
Answer: 28


[Question]: Mika had 20.0 stickers. She bought 26.0 stickers from a store in the mall and got 20.0 stickers for her birthday. Then Mika gave 6.0 of the stickers to her sister and used 58.0 to decorate a greeting card. How many stickers does Mika have left?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how many stickers Mika had after she bought some and got some for her birthday. 
She had 20.0 stickers, bought 26.0 stickers, and got 20.0 stickers for her birthday. 
So, she had 20.0 + 26.0 + 20.0 = 66.0 stickers.
Next, let's calculate how many stickers Mika had left after she gave some to her sister and used some to decorate a greeting card. 
She gave 6.0 stickers to her sister and used 58.0 stickers. 
So, she had 66.0 - 6.0 - 58.0 = 2.0 stickers left.
Answer: 2.0


[Question]: Luke had 20.0 stickers. He bought 12.0 stickers from a store in the mall and got 20.0 stickers for his birthday. Then Luke gave 5.0 of the stickers to his sister and used 8.0 to decorate a greeting card. How many stickers does Luke have left?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how many stickers Luke had after he bought some and got some for his birthday. 
He had 20.0 stickers, bought 12.0 stickers, and got 20.0 stickers for his birthday. 
So, he had 20.0 + 12.0 + 20.0 = 52.0 stickers.
Next, let's calculate how many stickers Luke had left after he gave some to his sister and used some to decorate a greeting card. 
He gave 5.0 stickers to his sister and used 8.0 stickers. 
So, he had 52.0 - 5.0 - 8.0 = 39.0 stickers left.
Answer: 39.0


[Question]: How many yards of material from a 24.0 yard length of cloth remains after 3.0 pieces each 3.5 yards long and 5.0 pieces each 2.25 long are removed?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how much material is used for the 3.0 pieces each 3.5 yards long. 
The total length of these pieces is 3.0 pieces * 3.5 yards/piece = 10.5 yards.
Next, let's calculate how much material is used for the 5.0 pieces each 2.25 yards long. 
The total length of these pieces is 5.0 pieces * 2.25 yards/piece = 11.25 yards.
So, the total length of material used is 10.5 yards + 11.25 yards = 21.75 yards.
Finally, let's calculate how much material remains from the 24.0 yard length of cloth. 
The remaining length is 24.0 yards - 21.75 yards = 2.25 yards.
Answer: 2.25


[Question]: If Bob can make 100.0 feet of rope in 2.0 hours and Tim can make 75.0 feet of rope in 2.0 hours, how many feet of rope can Bob and Tim working together make in 4.0 hours?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how much rope Bob and Tim can each make in one hour. 
Bob can make 100.0 feet / 2.0 hours = 50.0 feet/hour.
Tim can make 75.0 feet / 2.0 hours = 37.5 feet/hour.
Next, let's calculate how much rope Bob and Tim can make together in one hour. 
Working together, they can make 50.0 feet/hour + 37.5 feet/hour = 87.5 feet/hour.
Finally, let's calculate how much rope Bob and Tim can make together in 4.0 hours. 
In 4.0 hours, they can make 87.5 feet/hour * 4.0 hours = 350.0 feet.
Answer: 350.0


[Question]: A neighborhood grocer sells a mix of chocolate and carob candy. The chocolate cost 2.7 dollars a pound and the carob costs 2.55 dollars a pound. If 20.0 pounds of the chocolate and 40.0 pounds of the carob candy are used, what is the cost per pound of the mixture in dollars?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate the total cost of the chocolate and carob candy. 
The cost of the chocolate is 20.0 pounds * 2.7 dollars/pound = 54 dollars.
The cost of the carob candy is 40.0 pounds * 2.55 dollars/pound = 102 dollars.
So, the total cost of the mixture is 54 dollars + 102 dollars = 156 dollars.
Next, let's calculate the total weight of the mixture. 
The total weight is 20.0 pounds + 40.0 pounds = 60.0 pounds.
Finally, let's calculate the cost per pound of the mixture. 
The cost per pound is the total cost divided by the total weight. 
So, the cost per pound is 156 dollars / 60.0 pounds = 2.6 dollars/pound.
Answer: 2.6


[Question]: Tim got 3.0 nickels and 13.0 dimes for shining shoes, and in his tip jar found 7.0 dimes and 9.0 half - dollars. How much money did Tim get?
[Solution]:
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how much money Tim got from nickels. 
A nickel is worth 5 cents. So, 3.0 nickels are worth 3.0 * 5 = 15 cents.
Next, let's calculate how much money Tim got from dimes. 
A dime is worth 10 cents. So, 13.0 dimes from shining shoes are worth 13.0 * 10 = 130 cents.
And 7.0 dimes from the tip jar are worth 7.0 * 10 = 70 cents.
Then, let's calculate how much money Tim got from half-dollars. 
A half-dollar is worth 50 cents. So, 9.0 half-dollars are worth 9.0 * 50 = 450 cents.
Finally, let's add up all the money Tim got.
He got 15 cents from nickels, 130 cents from dimes for shining shoes, 70 cents from dimes in the tip jar, and 450 cents from half-dollars.
So, the total amount of money Tim got is 15 + 130 + 70 + 450 = 665 cents.
Since 100 cents make a dollar, Tim got 665 / 100 = $6.65.
Answer: 6.65
